				The <a href="http://www.softcover.io">Softcover</a> publishing platform was designed main for ebooks like the <a href="http://railstutorial.org/book"><em>Ruby on Rails Tutorial</em></a> book and <a href="https://learnenough.com/html"> <em>Learn Enough HTML to Be Dangerous</em></a> but it's also good for more traditional books, such as the novel <em>Moby-Dick</em> by Herman Melville (sometimes written as <em>Moby Dick</em>).We have presented below a short affectionately irreverent book report on this classic of American literature.

			<h3>Moby-Dick: A classical tale of the sea</h3>

				<img src="images/moby_dick.png" alt="Moby Dick"> <br><em>Moby-Dick</em>
				</a> by Herman Melville begins with these immortal words:
			</p>

			<blockquote>
				<p>
					<span>Call me Ishmael.</span> Some years ago- never mind how long precisely-having little or no money in my purse, and nothing particular to interest me on shore, I thought I would sail about a little and see the watery part of the world. It is a way I have of driving off the spleen and regulating circulation
				</p>
			</blockquote>

			<p>
				After driving off his spleen(which <em>can't</em> be good for you), Ishmael then goes on in much the same vein for approximately one jillion pages. The only thing bigger than Moby Dick (who <em>spoiler alert</em> is a giant white whale) is the book itself.
